## Features
- Multiplayer: Play with 2 or more players in real time
- Turn-based: Only one player can guess at a time
- Random 6-character code (letters and digits, no repeats)
- 12 guesses per game; win or reveal the answer
- Clean, modern UI with game rules and feedback

## Game Rules
1. The server randomly selects a 6-character code (letters and digits, no repeats).
2. Players take turns guessing the code. After each guess, the server responds with:
   - The number of correct characters in the correct position.
   - The number of correct characters in the wrong position.
   - The guess you made.
3. Example:
   - Secret: 620439
   - Player 1 guesses: 632057 â†’ Response: 1 (correct position), 3 (correct chars, wrong position)
4. At least 2 players are required.
5. Each game allows up to 12 guesses in total. If no one guesses correctly, the answer is revealed and a new game starts.
6. Only the player whose turn it is can guess. Others must wait for their turn.
